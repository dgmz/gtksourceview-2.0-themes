THEMES
------

###Poma ][###

This is a monochrome theme based on the colors of green phosphor CRT displays, 
like the one in old terminals or the Apple II. 

Because I don't specially appreciate the proliferation of styles used when
syntax highlighting, I just tried to keep the number of styles low, while 
keeping the features I find useful.

This is a variant of Poma ][, with darker text and lighter comments and 
keywords.
